# Learn CSS Flexbox and Grids
## Objective : 

We are going to faciliate the ultimate war between Super Heroes and Super Villains.

Milestone #1: As a first step we will build an arena and align the players against each other.

1. Create a html document `index.html`.
2. Using `CSS Grid`, create 3 columns one each for Heroes ,score and Villains in same order.
Note: Try to make it responsive and find the right size for each grid.
3. We need to add players to the left and right grids. Use the middle grid for the score.
4. Write CSS styles in `style.css`.

It should adhere to following conditions:
* Heroes on your left grid and Villains on the right grid.
* Heroes should be justified to the right and Villains to the left.
* Each player should have an image, name and strength(Number).
* Name and strength should be center aligned.
* Make the players equally spaced apart.

The final output should look like this
